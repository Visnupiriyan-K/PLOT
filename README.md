# 🏠 PLOT – Property Ledger & Ownership Tracker

---

## 📂 SECTION 1: Property Management Today & the Problem We Aim to Solve

Modern-day property management is mired in outdated practices and inefficiencies:

- 📄 Property management often involves **critical paperwork** and **manual ownership verification**.
- ⏱️ Processes are **time-consuming** and lack **transparency**.
- 🌐 Affected stakeholders include **government agencies, banks, citizens, and investors**.
- 🏛️ A **centralized authority** controls the data, leading to bottlenecks and trust issues.

### ❗ Problem Statement

> Property documents are often stored physically and can be easily tampered with. Verifying ownership involves manual checks with outdated systems. Lack of transparency, especially in real estate transactions. Limited access to records for owners or interested parties and lacks real-time verification or audit trail. High risk of fraud and duplication.
