# 🏠 PLOT – Property Ledger & Ownership Tracker

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**PLOT** is a mobile-first, blockchain-powered platform developed to revolutionize property registration, verification, and ownership transfer. It tackles core issues in the real estate sector—such as document fraud, data inaccessibility, and lengthy bureaucratic processes—by digitizing and decentralizing land records through blockchain and real-time data visualization.

> Developed as an academic project at **California State University, Long Beach**, PLOT combines blockchain, data analytics, UI/UX design, and product strategy to demonstrate an end-to-end prototype for digital property governance.
